# 🧠 Unraveling Brain ADHD – WiDS Datathon 2025

This repository presents my **first Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning project**, created for the **“Unraveling the Mysteries of the Female Brain” challenge** at the *WiDS Datathon 2025*.
The project investigates **gender-specific differences in ADHD** by analyzing **demographic, behavioral, and MRI-based data**.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset combines **demographic, behavioral, parental, and MRI information** along with ADHD outcome labels.

**Key Attributes:**

* **Demographics:** Age, sex, ethnicity, race, study site
* **Parental Assessments:** Positive parenting, corporal punishment, involvement scores
* **Behavioral Scales:** Conduct problems, hyperactivity, emotional problems, prosocial scale
* **MRI Information:** Laterality index, scan location, age at scan
* **Target:** ADHD outcome

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* **Data Analysis:** NumPy, Pandas
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (SVC, Ridge Regression, scaling, evaluation)
* **Statistical Testing:** SciPy
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 🔬 Workflow

1. **Data Understanding** – Attribute descriptions, distributions, and structure
2. **Data Cleaning** – Missing values, type corrections, and outlier handling
3. **EDA** – Visual exploration of distributions, correlations, and gender trends
4. **Feature Engineering** – Derived attributes to improve prediction power
5. **Modeling** – Built Support Vector Classifier (SVC) & Ridge Regression models
6. **Evaluation** – Measured accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices

## 📊 Key Findings

* ⚖️ Behavioral scores showed **gender-specific variations** in ADHD expression
* 👪 Parenting style (positive involvement vs. corporal punishment) correlated with ADHD outcomes
* 🧩 MRI laterality metrics demonstrated **predictive potential** for diagnosis

---

## 🎓 Learnings

* Structured approach to **EDA + ML workflows**
* Effective use of **statistics + visualizations** for healthcare datasets
* Ability to **translate technical findings** into clear insights

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
